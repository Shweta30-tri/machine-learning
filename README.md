# machine-learning
I have used preprocessed datasets of facial expressions captured in different contexts (e.g., cultural variations, lighting conditions). Train separate models for each context or develop a multi-context model that adapts its predictions based on additional input data (e.g., location, cultural background).  .Evaluated the model's ability.
